    content: 'Sand seas are easily recognizable in our solar system thanks to the patterns resulting from the self-organization of the dunes that compose them. However, a quantitative description of the emergence and evolution of these patterns is only available in simplified situations (constant unidirectional wind, homogeneous spatial conditions, etc.). We therefore seek to improve these theoretical descriptions by integrating the influence of various external parameters, such as seasonal wind variations or dune field edge conditions. By doing so, a reliable interpretation of field data in many different situations can be achieved, leading for example to a better prediction of the evolution of dunes and sand seas, but also to the deduction of environmental parameters (wind regime, sediment properties) from observations of dunes on satellite images in places where direct observations are not possible, like Mars or Venus.',

    desc: 'Powder snow avalanche at the Zinal ski station, in Switzerland.',
    content: 'Particle-laden gravity currents, or turbidity currents, are currents driven by a density difference induced by the presence of suspended particles (e.g. sand, snow, dust). They exist in a variety of environments, such as in the oceans, where sand mixes with water to generate currents capable of destroying underwater infrastructure, or near volcanoes, where hot ash released during eruptions becomes deadly pyroclastic currents. Their dynamics involve interactions on a range of spatial and temporal scales, from the particles to the turbulent structures of the flow, to the current itself and the topography of the underlying landscape.  In the laboratory, we study simplified situations, trying to isolate the impact of each process on the current dynamics. This allows us to create models (i.e. depth averages), which can then be used to assess the destructive potential in real/natural situations.',
