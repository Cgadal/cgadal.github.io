However, a quantitative descriptions of how these patterns emerge and evolve is only available in the simplified situations (constant unidirectional wind, homogenous spatial conditions, etc ..). We therefore aim to improve these theoretical descriptions by integrating the influence of various external parameters, such as the wind seasonal variations or the conditions at the edge of the dune field By doing so, reliable interpretation of field data in many dfferent situations can be achieved, leading for exemple to a better prediction of the evolution of dunes and sand seas, but also to the inference of environmental parameters (wind regime, sediment properties) from dune observations in satellite images in places where direct are not feasible, such as Mars or V\xe9nus.",points:["Theoretical description of dune morphodynamics (instabilities, non-linearities)","Numerical work and experiments","Brindging the gap between theory/lab work and field data (elevation, meteorological)"]},{title:"Particle-ladden gravity currents.",image:"/images/projects/avalanche_crop.jpg",date:"",desc:"Powder snow avalanche at the Zinal ski station, in Switzerland.",content:"Particle-ladden gravity currents, or turbidity currents, are currents driven by a density difference induced by the presence of particles in suspension (e.g. sand, snow, dust). They exist in various environments, such as in oceans, where sand mixes with water to generate currents able to destroy submarine infrastuctures, or near volcanos, where the hot ashes realeased during eruptions transform into deadly pyroclastic currents. Their dynamics involves interactions across a whole range of spatial and temporal scales, from between the particles and the flow turbulent structures to between the current itself and the underlying landscape topography. In the lab, we study simplified situations, trying to isolate the impact of each process  on the current dynamics. This helps creating models (i.e depth-averaged), that can be further used to assess destructive potential of real/natural situations.",points:["Shallow water modelling","Experimental work","Ultrasound measurements"]}],l=function(){return(0,i.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"Research projects",description:"Learn about Cyril Gadal's projects.",children:(0,i.jsxs)("article",{className:"post",id:"projects",children:[(0,i.jsx)("header",{children:(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,i.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,i.jsx)(a.rU,{to:"/projects",children:"Research projects"})}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:"An overview of my current research projects"})]})}),o.map((function(e){return(0,i.jsx)(r,{data:e},e.title)}))]})})}}}]);
